# Portugal air temperature (1980-2021) ground data versus ERA5Land Reanalysis data

This repository includes 15 datasets of mean daily air temperature obtained from 94 meteorological stations located in Portugal mainland (SNIRH, 2022) and the corresponding datasets from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (Muñoz Sabater 2019; Muñoz Sabater 2021). These datasets were considered for the development the following study: Almeida, M.C. and Coelho P.S., 2023: A first assessment of ERA5-Land reanalysis air temperature over Portugal mainland. The ERA5-Land datasets were corrected with 15 different lapse rates, ranging from 0 ºC to 7ºC (0.5 ºC step) to adjust air temperature for the altitudes differences. Considering the results obtained, a LR value of -2.0 ºC/1000 m was the final choice to evaluate the ERA5-L datasets accuracy.
