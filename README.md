# Portugal air temperature (1980-2021) ground data versus ERA5Land Reanalysis data

This repositores includes 15 datasets of mean daily air temperature obtained from 94 meteorological stations (SNIRH, 2022) and the corresponding datasets from the ERA5-Land reanalysis (Muñoz Sabater 2019; Muñoz Sabater 2021). The ERA5-Land datasets were corrected with 15 diferent lapse rates, varing from 0 ºC to 7ºC (0.5 ºC step) to adjust air temperature for the altitudes differences. Considering the results obtained, a LR value of -2.0 ºC/1000 m was the final choice to evaluate the ERA5-L datasets accuracy.


The results of this study are described in the following manuscript: Almeida, M.C. and Coelho P.S., 2023: A first assessment of ERA5-Land reanalysis air temperature over Portugal mainland.
